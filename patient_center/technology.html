        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Rather than placing dental impression materials in your mouth for the fabrication of crowns, veneers or bridges, this technology uses computer imaging to exactly reproduce the teeth and adjacent gum tissue. After the tooth is prepared for the crown, a small camera takes thousands of images of the area. These images are then securely transmitted to our laboratory in Clearwater, FL. The restorations are prepared using lasers, CAD/CAM technology and traditional porcelain techniques to design a crown, veneer or bridge that fits precisely with very minimal adjusting when cementing the product into the existing prepared tooth. The imaging system does not produce any radiation or cause any harmful effects to your mouth or body.

        <h2 class="right-line">Digital Radiography</h2>
        <p>Digital x-rays are quickly becoming adopted by a large percentage of the dental industry. A digital x-ray allows us to take an image of the tooth or teeth and instantly view it in an imaging program. Within this imaging program, we have a number of tools that allow us to take a very close look at the teeth and surrounding structures with amazing accuracy. As an added benefit, digital radiography also reduces radiation exposure by nearly 80% compared to a standard x-ray.</p>

        <h2 class="right-line">Intraoral Camera</h2>
        <p>The intraoral camera is an amazing diagnostic tool for viewing different angles in the mouth. The camera gives us the ability to view the entire mouth on a monitor so that we can get a closer look at any potential issues or problems that may arise. In addition, you will have the ability to see for themselves firsthand the same images we are seeing. These digital images are also excellent for gaining procedure acceptance from insurance companies.</p>
