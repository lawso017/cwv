- name: Bonding and White Filling
  summary: |
    <p>Bonding is a popular method to enhance the aesthetics of your smile. Bonding can be used to correct cracks or gaps in teeth, as a filling after a cavity has been removed, or to cover up stains or discolored teeth.</p>
  detail: |
    <p>A composite resin is used on the affected tooth or teeth. It is molded and sculpted over an adhsive gel that is placed on the tooth. After the resin has been applied an ultraviolet light is used to harden the resin, which is then polished to give you a fresh, new smile.</p>
    <p>Bonding is an obvious improvement over unsightly silver amalgam fillings. With the advancements in dental technology, bonding usually lasts for over 10 years. It is a safe, affordable, and attractive solution for many dental problems.</p>

- name: Bridges
  summary: |
    <p>Dental bridges are a great way to replace missing teeth. Your existing teeth are used to literally create a bridge to cross the area where your tooth is missing. Bridges are made from gold, metal, alloys, or porcelain to ensure that they are strong and durable.</p>
  detail: |
    <p>The process of creating a bridge begins by creating abutments out of your existing teeth where the bridge will be attached. The existing teeth are re-contoured to provide a base for the bridge. After the abutments have been created, an image is taken of the area which is sent through the internet to our lab in Clearwater, FL. The restorations are prepared using lasers, CAD/CAM technology and traditional porcelain techniques to design a bridge that fits precisely with very minimal adjusting when cementing the product into the existing prepared area. The imaging system does not produce any radiation or cause any harmful effects to your mouth or body. For more information on this imaging technology, visit <a href="http://www.itero.com" target="_blank">www.itero.com</a>. The bridge consists of two crowns on either end to place on the abutments and a pontic, which is the new tooth that replaces your missing tooth.</p>
    <p>We will fit you with a temporary bridge while we wait for the lab to craft your permanent bridge. This will protect the abutments and the exposed gum areas and look more appealing than having a missing tooth. When the permanent bridge has been created, you will have a follow up visit to set the bridge. It will be placed on the abutments and the dentist will then use an adhesive to make sure that the bridge is set.</p>
    <p>The bridge may take a little while to get used to, but after a few days it should feel like you have your own teeth back again. You should eat soft foods for the first few days after having your bridge placed. After the initial phase, you will be able to eat whatever you want with no issues.</p>
    <p>If you are missing a tooth you should strongly consider having it replaced. Besides the aesthetic disadvantage of missing a tooth, it could also cause structural changes to your mouth and jaw, as well as making it difficult to eat or speak properly.

- name: Crowns
  summary: |
    <p>Crowns can be made from porcelain, porcelain fused to metal, or a full gold crown. To maintain a natural look and feel a porcelain finished crown is best, as it can be matched to the shade of your other teeth. This will allow it to blend in and appear just like one of your natural teeth. We're proud that all of our crown manufacturing and laboratory work are done within the State of Florida.</p>
  detail: |
    <p>Over time our teeth begin to weaken and become more susceptible to problems such as decay, cracks, discoloration and others. If you feel your smile isn't what it once was, crowns can help you recover your smile. If your dentist notices that a tooth is decayed or seems weakened/cracked a crown may be necessary to make sure that there are no additional problems with the tooth. In cases like this a filling or bonding will not be sufficient.</p>
    <p>The process of installing a crown takes 2-3 visits to the dentist. On the first visit the tooth will be reshaped by filing down the enamel so that the crown can be placed over it. You will be given a local anesthetic before this part of the procedure so that you do not experience any discomfort. Once the tooth has been reshaped, an image is taken of the area which is sent through the internet to our lab in Clearwater, FL. The restorations are prepared using lasers, CAD/CAM technology and traditional porcelain techniques to design a crown that fits precisely with very minimal adjusting when cementing the product into the existing prepared area. The imaging system does not produce any radiation or cause any harmful effects to your mouth or body. For more information on this imaging technology, visit <a href="http://www.itero.com" target="_blank">www.itero.com</a>. Before leaving, the dentist will fit you with a temporary crown until your permanent crown is ready.</p>
    <p>The crown takes about 2-3 weeks to be returned to us. At this time you will have another appointment to place and fit the permanent crown. You will again have a local anesthetic to numb the area and the tooth will be placed using a cement to ensure the tooth sets in place. When you look in the mirror, you will see your old smile back. Crowns are durable and will usually last about 10-15 years. You should care for it as you would any of your other teeth with regular brushing and flossing. Call us today if you would like to learn more about how crowns can help restore your smile.</p>

  summary: |
    <p>Keeping our teeth their whitest is a lot harder than it sounds. Teeth whitening is an excellent way to restore the natural color of your teeth, or even make them whiter if you desire.</p>
  detail: |
    <p>To accomplish the whitening of your teeth, we utilize a tray whitening system. This tray whitening system is completed in 2 steps. The first step is to make an impression of your teeth. With this impression, we'll craft you custom whitening trays that you can use over and over. Finally, you will take the whitening gel and put it in the gel for a short period of time over a period of a few days. This often results in a whiter smile of 4-8 shades!</p>

- name: Crown Lengthening
  summary: |
    <p>Crown Lengthening is done for restorative dentistry and to improve the esthetics of your gum line. This procedure adjusts the gum and bone level to expose more of the tooth so it can be restored. Sometimes crown lengthening is done to improve a "gummy" smile because the teeth appear short.</p>
  detail: |
    <p>General practitioners often refer for crown lengthening procedures prior to restoration of broken or severely decayed teeth. This procedure adjusts the gum and bone level to expose more of the tooth so it can be restored. The teeth may actually be the proper length but excess gum tissue may be covering these teeth. During this procedure, excess gum and bone tissue is reshaped to expose more of the natural tooth.</p>

- name: Veneers
  summary: |
    <p>Veneers are an excellent way to redesign and reshape your entire mouth. Veneers are a very thin ceramic shell that covers your existing tooth structure. In placing these new veneers on your teeth, you are able to fix the look of issues such as staining, cracked teeth, spaces, misaligned teeth, chipped teeth and many other issues.</p>
  detail: |
    <p>In terms of the process to place veneers, it is a process that takes approximately two to three visits. In the first visit, we will discuss the new shape and look of what we are going to accomplish by placing the veneers. Once we have put a plan in place, we will carefully prepare the teeth for the placement of the new veneers. As we complete this piece of the process, the next step is to take an impression of the newly prepared teeth. This impression will be sent to our laboratory for the final product to be fabricated. We only utilize the highest standard laboratory for fabrication of all of our work. This process at the laboratory takes between 10-14 days. While the new veneers are being fabricated at the lab, we will provide you with a beautiful temporary solution to wear for this time.</p>
    <p>As the veneers are finalized, we will make every effort to make sure that your new veneers will feel just like your natural teeth. We will bond them into place ensuring that you can enjoy your new smile for a very long time!</p>

- name: Dental Implants
  summary: |
    <p>Now patients who are missing teeth have a strong, beautiful alternative to bridges, partials, or full dentures. Dental implants will improve your smile and your lifestyle. They look, feel, and function like natural teeth because of a titanium anchor attached to the jawbone. Implants can also anchor bridges, partials, or full dentures to eliminate slipping.</p>
  detail: |
    <p>After a thorough evaluation, the dentist can tell you whether you're a candidate for dental implants. They require adequate bone structure for placement. The first stage of the procedure involves oral surgery in which a titanium post is implanted into the jawbone for each missing tooth or for the new teeth that will anchor a bridge or denture. Nature will take its course, allowing your bone tissue to fuse with the titanium post. This creates a solid foundation.</p>
    <p>Once the implants are secured, the dentist will attach a handcrafted, permanent crown to each post. The restorations will match your natural teeth and blend seamlessly with your smile.</p>
    <p>By imitating an entire natural tooth, from the root up, dental implants offer a prosthetic that closely mimics nature. The result? Dental implant patients enjoy restored function, which allows a healthy diet of hard-to-chew foods. Speech may also improve. Strong and secure, your new smile will boost your confidence, enhance your appearance, and improve your quality of life.</p>
